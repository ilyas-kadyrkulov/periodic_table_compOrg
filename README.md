# Simple Periodic Table


## Briefly about how it works

### element class with variables 
![elementClass](https://i.imgur.com/kJXLaGs.png)

### for each element there is a pictureBox, each stores element's respective data, which then goes to Form2

### labels in Form2 get the data and output them

## The project still has a long way to go.
> Only 36 elements from 0 to 36 can be seen.
> 
> Images in this project get downloaded through url, so please use internet :)
> 
> It would be better if the images were loaded into the project folder.
